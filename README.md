# Tableau-Dashboard
We have designed an Earthquake dashboard for Researchers, Emergency Response Teams and Educators studying earthquake patterns and trends. 

They can use this dashboard for:
●	Understanding the frequency and intensity of earthquakes over time and their global distribution
●	Analyzing patterns and trends in earthquake activity, such as identifying clusters or hotspots of seismic activity
●	Comparing earthquake data across different regions, countries, or time periods
●	Educating the students about the frequency and intensity of earthquakes in their region or around the world.

The following are some of the preprocessing steps we performed:
Data Cleaning: correcting errors, inconsistencies, or missing values from the dataset. This was done by identifying and removing duplicates, filling in missing values, and correcting errors.
